Contributions are more than welcome!

Each PR has a suite of tests that run on SauceLabs. If you make a PR from a fork, they are likely to fail because SauceLabs require the PR to be made from a branch made on top of the upstream remote.
If you make a PR an admin will reopen your PR as a new branch, so we'll make it merge-able - don't worry!
